This solution must be run on Apache because it uses .htaccess to
create Search Engine Friendly URLs.  Apache also needs the mod_rewrite module enabled
and the website files must be in the root folder of the server (or a virtual
host)

Also make sure hidden files are visible so you can confirm .htaccess is actually there.
If it's not (though it should be), this should go in it:

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^?]*)$ /index.php [NC,L,QSA]
